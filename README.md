# ExploitFixer

ExploitFixer is a high performance packet filter that prevents many kinds of crashers, laggers and exploits from being used in your Spigot/Paper server.

Since the download link costs money, I've taken upon myself to maintain a working build for this project that you can now download directly from this repo's action artifacts. The paid link will still be included if you want to support the project.
