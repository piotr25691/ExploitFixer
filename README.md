# ExploitFixer

ExploitFixer is a high performance packet filter that prevents many kinds of crashers, laggers and exploits from being used in your Spigot/Paper server.

Since the download link costs money, I've taken upon myself to maintain a working build for this project, so you can compile it for use in your Minecraft server. I will still keep the paid links if you want to pay for a ready-to-use version.
